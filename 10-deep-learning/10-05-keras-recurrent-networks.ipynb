    "sub-layers. The first is a Multi-head Self-Attention mechanism, and the second is a position-wise Feed-Forward network. Both sub-layers are wrapped by a Residual Connection, followed by Layer Normalization (denoted by *Add & Norm* in the image). The output of the last encoder layer will be used as input for the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoder is also composed of 6 identical layers. These layers are similar to encoder layers, with two changes. First, the Self-Attention sub-layer is applied with a mask vector so that the prediction of a token is only made by previous tokens. Second, a third sub-layer being a Multi-head Cross-Attention mechanism is inserted to each decoder layer, in order to perform attention over the encoder output."

    "#### Multi-head Attention\n",
    "The Attention mechanism in Transformer is similar to Luong-style Attention with dot product alignment function, with the following improvements:\n",
    "- The dot-product alignment is divided by $\\sqrt{d_k}$, where $d_k$ is the dimension of keys. This is because for big matrices, dot products grow large in magnitude, thus push the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients. The effect of this scaling factor is to stablize gradients.\n",
    "- Queries, keys and values go through a Feed Foward layer first, before being fed into Attention mechanism. This layer is represented as matrix multiplication, in which the respective weight matrices are $\\mathbf{W}_q$, $\\mathbf{W}_k$ and $\\mathbf{W}_v$.\n",
    "- Each Attention mechanism described earlier is a called a *head*. Transformer uses Multi-head Attention, each head learns a different set of weight matrices and thus can capture dependencies in a different range."

    "#### Self-Attention\n",
    "Recurrent networks, despite how complicated the architectures are, still struggle from the problem of capturing long-term dependencies. Another weakness is the sequential behaviour, which prevents training in parallel and thus makes the network not scalable. So, instead of developing a new Recurrent architecture, Transformer's author propose and apply Self-Attention which addresses both problems. Self-Attention uses the embeddings of the source sentence for all queries, keys and values. What Self-Attention trying to learn can be thought of a correlation matrix in which each token represents a feature."

    "#### Positional Encoding\n",
    "Unfortunately, Self-Attention by nature is not aware of order of words. Thus, a technique called Positional Encoding is added to the input embeddings. Denote $D$ the size of embedding vectors and $T$ the sequence length, the formula for Positional Encoding is given by:\n",
