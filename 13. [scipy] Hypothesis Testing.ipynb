    "# 1. Basic concepts\n",
    "[Hypothesis testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) is a method of statistical inference that tests the validity of a claim about the population, using sample data. It makes use of the following concepts."

    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "- The [null hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis) (denoted $H_0$): a common view whose validity needs to be tested.\n",
    "- The [alternative hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_hypothesis) (denoted $H_1$): what will be believed if $H_0$ is rejected."

    "### Significance level\n",
    "[Significance level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance) (denoted $\\alpha$) is a pre-selected number ranges from $0$ to $1$, indicates the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis. Common values of $\\alpha$ is $0.05$ and $0.01$. A related concept to significance level is [confidence level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval) (denoted $\\gamma=1-\\alpha$). Each significance level corresponds to a critical value ($c$)."

    "Being one of the most important factors, [test statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_statistic) (denoted $T$) is the transformed data that follows a theoretical distribution. Since the probability distribution function is known, it allows calculating the probability value, telling which hypothesis is more likely to happen. Each test statistic is represented by a fraction where:\n",

    "[p-value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value) is the probability of making [type I error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors) - rejecting $H_0$ when it's true. It represents the probability of $H_0$ being true, and when this probability is less than $\\alpha$, $H_0$ should be rejected. The smaller the p-value is, the stronger the evidence that $H_0$ should be rejected.\n",
    "- A p-value less than $0.05$ indicates the difference is significant, meaning there is a probability of less than $5\\%$ that the null hypothesis is correct. Therefore, $H_0$ is rejected and $H_1$ is accepted.\n",
    "- A p-value higher than $0.05$ indicates the difference is not significant. In this case, $H_1$ is rejected but $H_0$ is failed to be rejected."

    "[ANOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance) (Analysis of Variance) is a technique involving a collection of statistical tests analyzing the difference of the means of two or more groups. The means is calculated from a quantitative variable; the groups are determined using qualitative variables."
