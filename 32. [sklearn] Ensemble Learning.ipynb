    "# 1. Overview\n",
    "Classical Machine Learning algorithms are usually shown to be poor when handling real-world datasets. Models fit from these algorithms often suffer from two problems: high bias and high variance; such a model is called a *weak learner*. In this topic, we are going through some elegant techniques that combine multiple weak learners to form a powerful model, which produces an improved overall result. This is referred to generally as [Ensemble Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning). Enemble Learning methods have proven their effectiveness in many Machine Learing competitions."

    "# 4. Boosting\n",
    "[Boosting](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning)>) works in the same spirit as Bagging: it also build a group of *homogeneous* models to obtain a more powerful predictor. The difference is that Boosting trains weak models sequentially while Bagging perform the training independently. The idea behind Boosting is to fit models iteratively such that the training of each model depends on the previous ones. Using this strategy, badly handled observations in the earlier steps will be taken care better in the later steps. Since the Boosting method puts its efforts on important cases, we end up have a strong learner with lower bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many competitions, Boosting methods used on Decision Trees are so effective for tabular datasets and is widely used by top competitors. For the rest of this article, we will take a deep dive into a bunch of interesting Boosting algorithms. To start off, let's take a quick overview of two Boosting approaches, Adaptive Boosting and Gradient Boosting. They do both train trees consequently, but behave differently. We first denote: $\\eta$ - the learning rate, $T$ - the number of iterations, $f^{(t)}$ and $f^{(t)}(\\mathbf{X})$ - the tree number $t$ and its predicted value for $t=1,2,\\dots,T$.\n",

    "## 4.1. Adaptive Boosting\n",
    "[Adaptive Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost) was originally designed for binary classification problems. This method can be used to boost any algorithm, but Decision Tree is always the go-to choice. More specifically, Decision Trees used here are very shallow, they only have one root and two leaves, explaining why they are also called Decision Stumps."

    "## 4.2 Gradient Boosting\n",
    "[Grandient Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) is another boosting strategy beside Adaptive Boosting. The idea of this method is mostly inspired by [Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent), thus the name Gradient Boosting. Just like other ensembling methods, this algorithm works best on Decision Trees and becomes the foundation for its modern variants such as XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost.\n",
