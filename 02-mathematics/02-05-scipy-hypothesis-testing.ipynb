Common values of $\\alpha$ is $0.05$ and $0.01$. A related concept to significance level is [confidence level] (denoted $\\gamma=1-\\alpha$).

The smaller the p-value is, the stronger the evidence that $H_0$ should be rejected.\n",

A Pearson's chi-squared is upward bias for 2x2 contingency table - an upwards bias tends to make results larger than they should be so Yate's correction is a regularization term in the formula of chi-squared statistic. However, Yate correction shouldn't be used because the correction is too strict for making the decision on data.
