    "# 1. Ensemble Learning overview\n",
    "Classical Machine Learning algorithms are usually shown to be poor when handling real-world datasets. Models fit from these algorithms often suffer from two problems: high bias and high variance; such a model is called a *weak learner*. In this topic, we are going through some elegant techniques that combine multiple algorithms to form a powerful model, which produces an improved overall result. This is referred to generally as [Ensemble Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning). Enemble Learning methods in fact have proved their effectiveness in many Machine Learing competitions."

    "## 1.1. Voting\n",
    "[Voting](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#voting-classifier) (for classification) or [Averaging](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#voting-regressor) (for regression) is the simplest ensembling method. When doing voting for classification, there are two strategies can be applied: marjority voting on predicted results (hard voting) and taking argmax of the weighted average of predicted probabilities (soft voting)."

    "## 1.4. Boosting\n",
    "[Boosting](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosting_(machine_learning)>) works in the same spirit as Bagging: it also build a group of *homogeneous* models to obtain a more powerful predictor. The difference is that Boosting trains weak models sequentially while Bagging perform the training independently. The idea behind Boosting is to fit models iteratively such that the training of each model depends on the previous ones. Using this strategy, badly handled observations in the earlier steps will be taken care better in the later steps. Since the Boosting method puts its efforts on important cases, we end up have a strong learner with lower bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "In applications, Boosting methods used on Decision Trees are so effective for tabular datasets and is widely used by top competitors. For the rest of this article, we will go through a bunch of interesting Boosting algorithms. To start off, this section discuss the first successful method in the Boosting family, [Adaptive Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost) (AdaBoost).\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost was originally designed for binary classification problems. This method can be used to boost any algorithm, but Decision Tree is always the go-to choice. More specifically, Decision Trees used here are very shallow, they only have one root and two leaves, explaining why they are also called Decision Stumps."

    "AdaBoost takes the following inputs:\n",
    "- A dataset having $N$ observations $(\\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y})=\\{(\\mathbf{x}_n,y_n)\\}_{n=1}^N$ where $y_n\\in\\{-1,1\\}$\n",

    "*Step 2.* For $t=1,2,\\dots,T$:\n",

    "   $$\\displaystyle{\\epsilon_t=\\sum{w_n^{(t)}\\;\\left[\\hat{y}_n\\neq y_n\\right]}}$$\n",

    "### The idea and mathematical behind xgboost\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of fitting XGboost to the training data is making the initial prediction $p_0$ (default is `0.5` for both regression and classification). Like GBM, XGboost fit a tree to the residual of each observation but each tree in XGboost is unique. XGB build a tree which try to minimize the equation:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}L(y_i,p_{i}^0+O_{value}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda*{O^2_{value}}  \\space \\mbox{(1)}$$\n",
    "with $L$ is *loss function* and ($\\frac{1}{2}\\lambda*{O^2_{value}}$) is *regularization term*.\\\n",
    "The goal of XGB is finding the optimal output value to minimize the equation $(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make an Xgboost tree, firstly we calculate the residuals of each obs different to initial prediction then making similariry score for the root:\n",
    "$$\\mbox{Similariry Score} = \\frac{(\\sum gradient)^2}{\\sum hessian + \\lambda}$$\n",
    "Similarity score tell us the similarity between residual of observations, if residuals is different, they cancel out the others so that the similarity score will be small. And $\\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, it's intend to reduce the prediction's sensitivity to individual observations and then prevent overfitting. When $\\lambda$ increase, the similarity score wil be decrease - the amount of decrease is inversely proportional to the number of residual in the node.\\\n",
    "After having the similarity for the root, we find an optimal split point for the tree. We'll choose one threshold to split the obs and then calculating similarity score for each node. To quantify how much better the leaves similar residual than the root, we calculate the gain:\n",
    "$$\\mbox{gain} = \\mbox{left}_{similarity} + \\mbox{right}_{similarity} - \\mbox{root}_{similarity}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compare the gain of this thresold to the others and the threshold which made the largest gain will be chosen. Continue building tree with other feature until getting the maximum split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have the full tree, to prune the tree, we use $\\gamma$ parameter. If $gain - \\gamma < 0$, we prune that leave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is find the output for each leaf of the tree. To do that, we derivate the equation $(1)$ and we get the formular for optimal output:\n",
    "$$O_{value}=\\frac{-\\sum gradient}{\\sum hessian + \\lambda}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The larger $\\lambda$, the closer output value to 0.\\\n",
    "Finally, we use the output value plus learning rate to make the new prediction:\n",
    "$$p_0 + \\sum_{m=1}^{m}\\eta * O_{value}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Like GBM, the process go on with the next tree which is build based on residual of previous tree. And ending by reaching the smallest residual or maximum tree.\n"

    "## LightGBM\n",
    "\n",
    "LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework which use tree based learning algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why lightgbm became powerful are:\n",
    "1. Optimization in accuracy: \n",
    "- LigthGBM uses *leaf_wise* stategy to grow the tree vertically. It will choose the leaf with max delta  loss to grow. \n",
    "- Optimal split for category feature. Other boosting can only use one-hot encoding for category feature but lightGBM can treat feature values equally although values in numeric (i.e: gender 0-unknow, 1-man, 2-woman)\n",
    "2.  Optimization in speed and memory usage: \n",
    "- LightGBM uses histogram-based algorithms, which bucket continuous feature values into discrete bins. Algo will find the best split between bins.\n",
    "- LightGBM uses Gradient-based one side sampling (GOSS) method. By usual, subsample process is done by taking random sample from dataset. But GOSS not only perform a faster way to do this but also keep distribution of the data. The instances with larger gradients (under-trained), contribute a lot more to the tree building process so we keep all instances with large gradient, but to prevent changing the distribution, we need to perform random sampling on instances with small gradients. Assume we have \n",
    "$n$ data instances, if we keep $a$ instances with large gradients and randomly samples $x$% $(n-a)$ instances with small gradients, we have the sampled data with size $a+ x$% $*(n-a)$. \n",
    "3. Sparse Optimization:\n",
    "- LightGBM handle sparse data by using Exclusive feature bundling (EFB). EFB is a technique that uses a greedy algorithm to combine (or bundle) these mutually exclusive (means never take non-zero in the same time) into a single feature and thus reduce the dimensionality.\n",
    "4. Optimization in Distributed Learning:\n",
    "- Distributed learning allows the use of multiple machines to produce a single model.\n",
    "- Feature parallel: Data had split vertically, each worker handle a subset of feature to find the best split on local feature set then they communicate to others to get the best one. \n",
    "- Data parallel: Data had split horizontally, each worker will construct the local histograms then merge them to make global histogram of the data and find the best split on global histogram. \n",
    "- Voting parallel: It is the special case of data parallel when communication cost is constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "||Data is small| Data is large\n",
    "|:--|:--|:--\n",
    "**Feature  is small**|Feature parallel|Data parallel|\n",
    "**Feature is large**|Feaure parallel|Voting parallel|\n",
    "\n",
    "LightGBM also supports GPU learning. The disadvantage of LGBM is it can easily overfit with small dataset and can't be use with one-hot encoding because of optimal category feature\n"
