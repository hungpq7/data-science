    "There are basically two ways to scrape data from websites, one is via HTML responses (server-side) and the other is via JSON responses (client-side).\n",
    "- In the first method, we extract structured data from user interface, which is friendly for human eyes but not for computers. Because we scrape what we see, data will be availale most of the time except for cases such as when website owners protect their data using images rather than raw text. This crawling approach requires some basic knowledge of HTML.\n",
    "- In the second method, we try to crawl REST API responses, which is only available in specific website that use this protocol. The advantage is that the returned data is in JSON format, so they can be easily extracted and processed. Crawling data this way is much easier, so we are going to start with it."
