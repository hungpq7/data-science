    "# 1. Recommendation concepts\n",
    "A [recommender system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system) or recommendation engine is a program that aims to suggest the most relevant *items* to each *user*. With the rise of digital services, recommender systems have taken more and more places in human's life. Some successful recommender systems are of large companies such as Netflix, Google and Amazon."

    "### Approaches\n",
    "As seen in familiar services, there are a lot of recommendation kinds such as \"similar products\", \"best seller products\", \"most relevant products\" and \"people view this also buy this\". Basically, every recommendation problem is some sort of a ranking system, with or without scores; and some ranking problems can be done only by calculating items' statistics. This section focuses on the most challenging problem, recommendation of most relevant products to a user. Typically, there are two most noticeable recommendation methods:\n",
    "- *Collaborative Filtering*. This technique tries to discover people that have the same taste as an user $u$, then recommends to $u$ items have been highly rated by these people. Imagine there are a lot of people who have watched both \"Iron Man\" and \"Captain America\", then if $u$ watches one of two movies, the other will be recommended.\n",
    "- *Content-based Filtering*. This technique draws a picture of the user $u$'s behaviours, it suggests items that are similar to what $u$ has purchased in the past. For example, if $u$ is a Netflix user and has watched so many fantasy movies, then the engine should recommend to $u$ a movie also having the fantasy genre.\n",
    "- *Demographic Filtering*, which identifies people that are demographically similar to a user, then extrapolates from their ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the three, Collaborative Filtering is considered the most effective; however, the other approaches still have their own advantages. Therefore, many modern recommender systems use hybridization, which combines two or more methods to gain better performance than individual implementation."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Cold start problem\n",
    "This problem refers to the situation where a recommendation system (especially Collaborative Filtering) fails to predict the ratings for new users and new items, as there are insufficient data for the system to work accurately. Fortunately, Content-based Filtering and Demographic Filtering suffer from this problem less than Collaborative Filtering does:\n",
    "- For new users, Demographic Filtering will find existing users that are demographically similar to them\n",
    "- For new items, Content Filtering will find similar items based on item metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "This explains why hybrid systems are preferred in business and become very successful. Another implementation that can help solve the cold-start problem is to directly ask new users what they do like."

   "source": [
    "### Utility matrix\n",
    "In a recommendation system, there are two important entities, being referred to as *users* and *items*. Each user has preferences for some of the items, they can be in the form of rating scores (from 1 to 5) or binary status (like/not like). The whole data is represented as a *utility matrix*, sometimes called *user-item matrix*, illustrated as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "|         |item1|item2|item3|item4|\n",
    "|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n",
    "|**user1**|5    |1    |     |     |\n",
    "|**user2**|3    |2    |     |     |\n",
    "|**user3**|     |     |     |5    |\n",
    "|**user4**|     |     |4    |     |\n",
    "|**user5**|     |4    |     |4    |\n",
    "|**user6**|2    |     |1    |3    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Since digital products are designed to serve many people at once, the number of users is usually much larger than the number of items. And as each user only gives ratings to a small number of items, the utility matrix is a sparse matrix most of the time, where most of the entries are null. It is almost impossible to build a recommender system without a utility matrix. There are two ways of collecting data in order to make a utility matrix.\n",
    "- *Explicit ratings*, which come directly from asking users to rate items. Easy to collect but usually comes with a lot of missing data, since users are lazy. The rating scores are not trustworthy (depending on personal perspective) and are not updated over time.\n",
    "- *Implicit ratings*, which are inferences from users' behavior. This method requires to have some sort of unsupervised formula/rule to map a user's actions to his ratings. Unlike explicit ratings, implicit ratings are much more trustworthy (behaviors are unconscious) and are up to date."

    "Depends on how we build a recommendation system, there are two types of metric can be used to assess its quality. If we have predicted the ratings, then [regression metrics](https://nbviewer.org/github/hungpq7/data-science/blob/main/26.%20%5BScikit-learn%5D%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb#3.3.-Regression-metrics), especially RMSE, are usually chosen. This section mainly focuses on metrics that help us evaluate how well we have sorted the recommended items. For illustration purpose, we assess the performance of a simple baseline model run on the MovieLens dataset."

This is where Average Precision and Average Recall up to the $k^{th}$ item (AP@k and AR@k) is used to tackle the problem.

    "[Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain) (nDCG) is another popular metric beside MAP@k. Despite having no *mean* and *@k* part in the name, NDCG shares the same calculation with MAP@k: computing the metric for a user considering the top $k$ items, then taking the mean of that metric for all users. The difference is that nDCG defined $rel_i$ being the continuous rating score rather than a binary status, hence it contains more information than MAP@k.\n",

    "[Matrix Factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization_(recommender_systems)) is a famous collaborative filtering technique, as popularized by Simon Funk during the [Netflix Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize). Note that this algorithm has nothing to do with [Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) (SVD); it is more likely of an SVD-like algorithm. However, the name SVD is still used for this family of methods. Besides, some documents refer to this algorithm as Alternating Least Squares (ALS); this name comes from an iterating method for minimizing the loss function."

    "### The algorithm\n",
    "The ultimate goal of the algorithm is to factorize the utility matrix $\\mathbf{R}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{U\\times I}$ (there are total of $U$ users and $I$ items) as the product of two low-dimensional matrices: $\\hat{\\mathbf{R}}=\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{Q}^{\\text{T}}$, where $\\mathbf{P}_{U\\times K}$ is the user embedding matrix and $\\mathbf{Q}_{I\\times K}$ is the item embedding matrix. The idea behind matrix factorization comes from an assumption that there are some kind of *latent features* (their number gives us the *rank* $K$ that satisfies $K\\ll U,I$) describing the relationship between users and items. Latent features can be thought as usual item features, but they are discovered by the model instead of being labeled manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "One major problem is that there are biases that appear in real-world applications, which have not been handled yet in the above embedding matrices. For example, a film critic tends to give lower ratings and some items always get higher ratings than average. To capture this, bias terms are introduced, organized in the bias matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ and is added to the product $\\mathbf{P}\\mathbf{Q}^{\\text{T}}$. Specifically, the rating user $u$ ($u=1,2,\\dots,U$) gives to item $i$ ($i=1,2,\\dots,I$) is predicted as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{r}_{ui}=\\mathbf{p}_u\\mathbf{q}_i+(b_u+b_i)+\\mu$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{p}_u$ is the $u^{\\text{th}}$ row-vector of $\\mathbf{P}$, indicating the ratings user $u$ gives to latent features\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{q}_i$ is the $i^{\\text{th}}$ row-vector of $\\mathbf{Q}$, representing the value of latent features for item $i$\n",
    "- $b_u$ and $b_i$ are the biases of user $u$ and item $i$; $b_u+b_i=\\mathbf{B}_{ui}$\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the average of all ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $\\mathbf{p}_u$, $\\mathbf{q}_i$, $b_u$ and $b_i$ are only defined when the corresponding user or item is known. To estimate all unknown, we minimize the following loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\mathbf{p}_u,\\mathbf{q}_i,b_u,b_i)\n",
    "=\\sum_{u=1,i=1}^{U,I}(r_{ui}-\\hat{r}_{ui})^2\n",
    "+\\lambda\\,(\\|\\mathbf{p}_u\\|^2+\\|\\mathbf{q}_i\\|^2+b_i^2+b_u^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda$ is the regularization coefficient and $\\|\\bullet\\|_{\\text{F}}$ denotes the [Frobenius norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Frobenius_norm) of a matrix. An intuitive illustration of the factorization process is shown below:\n",

    "### The algorithm\n",
    "This method is quite straightforward, it involves in these steps:\n",
    "- Represent each user/item as a vector extracted from the utility matrix. Normalize each vector by subtracting to it the average ratings of that user/item.\n",
    "- Calculate the similarity matrix for all pairs; the cosine distance is used most of the time.\n",
    "- Consider $K$ nearest neighbors, aggregate their ratings as prediction for the item $i$ that a user $u$ has not rated yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two strategies can be used in the K-NN method: user-based and item-based (some documents refer to them as user-user and item-item). In user-based approach, we try to figure out a maximum of $K$ users that are most similar to $u$, and investigate how they have rated $i$. In contrast, the item-based approach finds $K$ most similar items to $i$ that have been rated by $u$, and investigates how other people think about them. Note that only neighbors with positive similarity are aggregated, since it makes no sense to take into consideration unrelated users/items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say $v$ is one of $K$ nearest users of $u$ that have rated $i$ and $v$ is positive similar to $u$ ($s_{uv}>0$); $j$ is one of $K$ nearest items of $i$ that have been rated by $u$ and $j$ is positive similar to $i$ ($s_{ij}>0$). The prediction formulas are:\n",
    "- User-based:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{r}_{ui}=\\frac{\\sum s_{uv}r_{vi}}{\\sum s_{uv}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Item-based:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{r}_{ui}=\\frac{\\sum s_{ij}r_{uj}}{\\sum s_{ij}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the item-based approach is more popular as it computes a much smaller similarity matrix than the user-based approach does. Besides, the item-mean vector used in item-based is more *stable* than user-mean vector. It does not change too frequently when there are new ratings, because each item is rated by many users.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-NN is a computational expensive method when there are millions of users and items in real-world problems. A clustering algorithm can be paired with this method, now we calculate the similarity matrix on clusters of users/items instead of individual users/items. This technique can reduce a lot of computations, but you must trade-off some quality for scalability since the input data is now less detailed. There is also another improvement is calculating only the similarity between related users/items, since there are so many pairs having no common items/users."

Thanks to the centering technique, above-average rating movies show up and are considered to be positively rated.\n",
